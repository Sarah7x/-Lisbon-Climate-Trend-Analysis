# 🌤 Lisbon Climate Trend Analysis

🌐  Project Overview
---
This project meticulously examines Lisbon's climate dynamics over a decade, dissecting patterns in temperature and precipitation using NOAA’s extensive meteorological datasets. The objective is to decode the subtleties of Lisbon's climate, providing valuable insights into its local weather patterns and potential broader environmental implications.

📈 Quick Facts
---
- **Period of Analysis**: A decade-long investigation capturing comprehensive weather data.
- **Climate Narrative**: Showcased a stable climate with minimal long-term shifts.
- **Seasonal Rhythms**: Uncovered distinct seasonal cycles, with an absence of extreme weather anomalies.
  
🛠️ Methodology
---
A multifaceted analytical approach was adopted to refine, analyze, and interpret the dataset:

- **Data Processing**: Utilized Pandas to curate a well-structured, clean dataset for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied rigorous tests like Dickey-Fuller and Mann-Kendall to assess trends and stationarity.
- **Visualization**: Created compelling visual narratives using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

🖼️ Visual Insights
---
- **Annual Temperature Trends**: A line chart showcases Lisbon's seasonal warmth and coolness.
- **Precipitation Patterns**: A line chart articulates the city’s rainfall distribution, capturing both regular and sporadic precipitation events.

These visuals crystallize a decade of Lisbon's climate intricacies, encapsulating its characteristically temperate and dry disposition.
